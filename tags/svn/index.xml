      <description>This article in short describes an idea how to use SVN for Powerbuilder to improve development process. This solution is based on previously used CVS (described in another article).
CVS we were are using for about 6 years and it was working perfectly.
But currently we have to change hardware and operating system it was running on, so we decided to move forward and use a bit better but still free solution - SVN running on Windows.</description>
